c => cell cards.  note that a negative density implies
c    that the density is in g/cc (not atoms/cc).
c    material "0" is a vacuum, by definition.

c =>  the blank line above indicates the end of the cell
c     section.  the second section of the input deck contains
c     the surface cards.  note that surfaces #s 400-800 have
c     a "tr" card associated with them

c => define the source distribution.
c    particles :
c        are photons (particle type #2),
c        start on surface 100, 
c        start at (x,y,z) coordinates (0,0,-678),
c        have energies sampled from distribution #1,
c        have a direction cosine sampled from distribution #2.
