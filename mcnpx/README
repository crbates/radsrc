Directions for MCNPX build with RadSrc library
(tested with v2.5.0 and v2.6b)

(0) Build mcnpx from source code

(1) Download and install 'libradsrc.a'

(2) Copy source.F to /path_to_mcnpx/src/mcnpx/mcnpf

(3) Append the following line to /path_to_mcnpx/src/mcnpx/Makefile.h

    XLIBS := ${XLIBS} -L$(RADSRC_HOME) -lradsrc  -lstdc++

(4) Set environment variables for RadSrc 
    (works for both csh or sh type shells)
  
    source /path_to_RadSrc/setup

(5) Rebuild mcnpx with 'make install'

---------------------------------------------------
Directions for running MCNPX with RadSrc library :

(1) Create 'problem.in' to specify RadSrc parameters.
    At run time mcnpx will look for this file in the current directory. 

(2) Set environment variables for RadSrc 
    (works for both csh or sh type shells)

    source /path_to_RadSrc/setup
  
(3) Add 'IDUM n' to mcnpx input deck, where n is the internal cell 
    number in which cosmic rays will be generated.

----------------------------------------------------
The shell script 'test_radsrc' shows an example set of commands to run
a test job and compare the output with a reference. Edit this script to
match your local setup. Note that the example uses RDUM to specify the 
radius of the depleted uranium ball.

Example files:
  balltest
  problem.in

mcnpx inp=balltest
