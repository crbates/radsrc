This is the cog interface to radsrc library at LLNL.
You must be a member of group coguser to use this package.

To link and run demo on YANA (2-16-07)
  source ./setup
  make -C ../src clean intel libradsrc

  #....version that reads input from external file
  make -f COGUserlib.make.zeus in=IsoP.F
  COG10.31 testinput

  #....version that extracts input from cog input deck
  make -f COGUserlib.make.mcr in=rsint.F
  COG10.31 test.rsint

Version that takes RADSRC input from the COG input file.

The subroutine is called rsint.  It takes the standard format input.
Due to the limitations of the COG input processor the input words in
the RADSRC definition can not be greater than 8 characters (this
limitation applies to all COG input words).

ZEUS notes
  o Uses Intel compilers

MCR notes
  o Uses portland compilers
  o Portland compilers are defined by setup script (see setup.sh)
        source /usr/local/tools/pgi6.23/bin/startpgi.sh
  o getinc and COGUserlib.make copied from /usr/gapps/cog/MCR/usrdet
  o COGUserlib.make.mcr 
    o MCR uses platform type IntelLinux (defined by makefile)
    o To link with radsrc, added the following to LDOPTS:
         -L$(RADSRC_HOME)/lib -lradsrc -lC -lstd -lpgsse1 -lpgsse2
