Execute 'gmake' to compile the RadSrc library (lib/libradsrc.a) and
standalone application (bin/radsrc).

The default compiler system is GNU. You can select Intel or Portland
Group by including 'intel' or 'portland' as a target to the makefile.

Supported platforms are:
  GNU gcc, g++, g77
  Intel icc, icpc, ifort
  Portland Group pgc, pgCC, pgf90 or pgf77

* Execution

****

By default, the radsrc program (bin/radsrc) expects to find the
database in the location specified by the RADSRC_DATA environment
variable if present, or in the "data" subdirectory of your current
directory.

Execute the environment shell script (setup) to automatically setup
the environment variables RADSRC_HOME and RADSRC_DATA:

  source [PATH TO RADSRC DIRECTORY]/setup

The above command works for csh and sh type shells.

RadSrc will output the complete list of isotopes present in the aged
sample, and their concentrations (in absolute fractions, not percent).
It will also list gamma and x-ray emissions, first sorted by order,
then again sorted by intensity. These will be written to the file
output.lin. Additional files for MCNP/X (output.mci) or COG
(output.cog) will also be written if requested. You will be presented
with several options for preparing these input decks.
