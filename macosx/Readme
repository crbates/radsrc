Using radsrc via the MacOSX Finder
==================================

Double click 'run_radsrc' to begin an interactive session. You will
be prompted for all of the necessary input information.

Double click 'test_radsrc' to execute a test job that will also
compare the result to a standard reference.

Detailed documentation is in doc/radsrc.pdf


Using radsrc via the command line
=================================

To run radsrc from the command line, do this:

  bin/radsrc [input file]

The input file is optional. Radsrc reads from standard input,
so you can also run it like this:

  bin/radsrc < reference/input.txt

If you want to read in part of the problem from a file and continue
interactively do this:

  cat partial_input.txt - | bin/radsrc
