Can also implement mode in unix to use input file for part of input
and continue interactively:

#....if the user specified a file, cat it to the program
#
#    I use a pipe instead of <file, because the user can
#    choose to enter 'filename -', this will cat the file
#    and let the user continue to type via standard input.
#    Note that if the user does use this feature (-) an
#    extra carriage return is expected at the end of 
#    

echo
echo -n "Enter input file name [or hit return for interactive mode] "
read file
echo
[ "$file" ] && file="cat $file |"
eval $file bin/radsrc

Documentation:
You can chose to read in your entire setup from a text file by entering the
file name at the prompt. If you want to read in only part of the setup and then
continue interactively type the filename an append the '-' after a space, e.g.,
   
  partial_input_filename -
