Directions for MCNP build with RadSrc library
(tested with 5.1.40)

(0) Build mcnp5 from source code

(1) Download and install 'libradsrc.a'

(2) Copy source.F90 to /path_to_mcnp/Source/src

(3) Set environment variables for RadSrc 
    (works for both csh or sh type shells)
  
    source /path_to_RadSrc/setup

(4) Rebuild mcnp with 

    make reinstall  EXTRALIBS='-lstdc++ -L$(RADSRC_HOME)/lib -lradsrc'

---------------------------------------------------
Directions for running MCNP with RadSrc library :

(1) Create 'problem.in' to specify RadSrc parameters.
    At run time mcnp will look for this file in the current directory. 

(4) Set environment variables for RadSrc 
    (works for both csh or sh type shells)

    source /path_to_RadSrc/setup

  (3) Add 'IDUM n' to mcnp input deck, where n is the internal cell 
    number in which gammas will be generated.

----------------------------------------------------
The shell script 'test_radsrc' shows an example set of commands to run
a test job and compare the output with a reference. Edit this script to
match your local setup. Note that the example uses RDUM to specify the 
radius of the depleted uranium ball.

Example files:
  balltest
  problem.in

mcnpx inp=balltest
