This directory contains makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++ Ver. 6.

These makefiles are provided for your convenience. Neither this makefile
nor the resulting executables (or lack thereof) are supported.

To compile:

CD GSOURCE
NMAKE /F GSOURCE.MAK

Ensure that the Microsoft commandline compiler tools are in your path.

The Microsoft Visual C++ Ver 6 GUI will not recognize the .cc files as
C++ files and will not compile them.
